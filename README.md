#Topic Modelling on Tweets

Twitter is a microblogging platform, where millions of users daily share their attitudes, views, and opinions. Using an effective way to analyze a large set of tweets to find a set of topics in a computationally efficient manner is the objective of this project. Topic modelling is an essential algorithm used in text mining.  The basic idea is to treat the documents as mixtures of topics in the topic model, and each topic is viewed as a probability distribution of the words.
